1 - START
The project was developed entirely on Google Colab.
If you want to run the project on Google Colab, the dataset is downloaded
automatically from the project folder on Github.

If, on the other hand, you prefer to run the project locally, there are two steps:
1. Don't run the second cell of code, which downloads the dataset from Github;
2. Change the 'dataset_path' variable in the third cell of code by entering the local path
    to the 'Oil Spill Detection Dataset' folder.

2 - NECESSARY LIBRARIES
The project needs several libraries to work:
- Pandas;
- Numpy;
- Pyplot;
- Seaborn;
- Tensorflow and Keras;
- Os
- Zipfile
- Time
- Sklearn
